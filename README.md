This is the second part of the course of Algorithms and Data Structures 

of the academic year 2017/2018 of the University of Florence. 

> I'll try to implemente in a very simple (and dumb) way all the algorithms
  so even if you are novice i'll get the **Main Idea** quickly

1. The [randNumbers](https://github.com/DanerSound/Search-Algorithms/tree/randNumbers) :

   This is a very simple Java Class that generate some numbers for make the test using the algorithms.
   
   ps. If your are asking " why he didnt use the java base ramdon generation ? "... well because it i'll be to easy :D
